# Haskell Undefined Value Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Haskell programming: using the `undefined` value.  The `undefined` value represents a computation that has not been provided a value, leading to a runtime error when it's attempted to be used in a computation.  This example showcases the issue and how to fix it. 

The file `bug.hs` contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.hs` demonstrates the correction.
